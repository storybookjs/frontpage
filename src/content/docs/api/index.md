  We intentionally do not use markdown tables here because the required formatting (one row per line)
  makes it very difficult to read, particularly when comparing changes.
  Also, using HTML directly allows us to apply a consistent width to the first column.
  However, this means the links won't work when viewing in GitHub. :(
