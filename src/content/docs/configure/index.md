title: 'Configure Storybook'
---

Storybook is configured via a folder called `.storybook`, which contains various configuration files.

<Callout variant="info">

Note that you can change the folder that Storybook uses by setting the `-c` flag to your `storybook dev` and `storybook build` [CLI commands](../api/cli-options.md).

</Callout>

## Configure your Storybook project

Storybook's main configuration (i.e., the `main.js|ts`) defines your Storybook project's behavior, including the location of your stories, the addons you use, feature flags and other project-specific settings. This file should be in the `.storybook` folder in your project's root directory. You can author this file in either JavaScript or [TypeScript](./typescript.md). Listed below are the available options and examples of how to use them.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/main-config-typical.js.mdx',
    'common/main-config-typical.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<Callout variant="info">

This configuration file is a [preset](../addons/addon-types.md) and, as such, has a powerful interface, which can be further customized. Read our documentation on writing [presets](../addons/writing-presets.md) to learn more.

### Feature flags

Additionally, you can also provide additional feature flags to your Storybook configuration. Below is an abridged list of available features that are currently available.

| Configuration element | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `storyStoreV7`        | Configures Storybook to load stories [on demand](#on-demand-story-loading), rather than during boot up (defaults to `true` as of `v7.0`) <br/> `features: { storyStoreV7: true }`             |
| `buildStoriesJson`    | Generates `index.json` and `stories.json` files to help story loading with the on-demand mode (defaults to `true` when `storyStoreV7` is `true`) <br/> `features: { buildStoriesJson: true }` |
| `legacyMdx1`          | Enables support for MDX version 1 as a fallback. Requires [`@storybook/mdx1-csf`](https://github.com/storybookjs/mdx1-csf) <br/> `features: { legacyMdx1: true }`                             |

## Configure story loading

By default, Storybook will load stories from your project based on a glob (pattern matching string) in `.storybook/main.js|ts` that matches all files in your project with extension `.stories.*`. The intention is for you to colocate a story file along with the component it documents.

```
•
└── components
    ├── Button.js
    └── Button.stories.js
```

If you want to use a different naming convention, you can alter the glob using the syntax supported by [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#globbing-features).

For example, if you wanted to pull both `.md` and `.js` files from the `my-project/src/components` directory, you could write:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-main-js-md-files.js.mdx',
    'common/storybook-main-js-md-files.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### With a configuration object

Additionally, you can customize your Storybook configuration to load your stories based on a configuration object. For example, if you wanted to load your stories from a `packages/components` directory, you could adjust your `stories` configuration field into the following:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/main-config-stories-with-object.js.mdx',
    'common/main-config-stories-with-object.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

When Storybook starts, it will look for any file containing the `stories` extension inside the `packages/components` directory and generate the titles for your stories.

### With a directory

You can also simplify your Storybook configuration and load the stories using a directory. For example, if you want to load all the stories inside a `packages/MyStories`, you can adjust the configuration as such:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-storyloading-with-directory.js.mdx',
    'common/storybook-storyloading-with-directory.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### With a custom implementation

You can also adjust your Storybook configuration and implement custom logic to load your stories. For example, suppose you were working on a project that includes a particular pattern that the conventional ways of loading stories could not solve. In that case, you could adjust your configuration as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/main-config-stories-with-logic.js.mdx',
    'common/main-config-stories-with-logic.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### On-demand story loading

As your Storybook grows, it gets challenging to load all of your stories performantly, slowing down the loading times and yielding a large bundle. Out of the box, Storybook loads your stories on demand rather than during boot-up to improve the performance of your Storybook. If you need to load all of your stories during boot-up, you can disable this feature by setting the `storyStoreV7` feature flag to `false` in your configuration as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/main-config-features-story-store-v7.js.mdx',
    'common/main-config-features-story-store-v7.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Known limitations

Because of the way stories are currently indexed in Storybook, loading stories on demand with `storyStoreV7` has a couple of minor limitations at the moment:

- [CSF formats](../api/csf.md) from version 1 to version 3 are supported. The `storiesOf` construct is not.
- Custom`storySort` functions are allowed based on a restricted API.

## Configure story rendering

To control the way stories are rendered and add global [decorators](../writing-stories/decorators.md#global-decorators) and [parameters](../writing-stories/parameters.md#global-parameters), create a `.storybook/preview.js` file. This is loaded in the Canvas UI, the “preview” iframe that renders your components in isolation. Use `preview.js` for global code (such as [CSS imports](../get-started/setup.md#render-component-styles) or JavaScript mocks) that applies to all stories.

The `preview.js` file can be an ES module and export the following keys:

- `decorators` - an array of global [decorators](../writing-stories/decorators.md#global-decorators)
- `parameters` - an object of global [parameters](../writing-stories/parameters.md#global-parameters)
- `globalTypes` - definition of [globalTypes](../essentials/toolbars-and-globals.md#global-types-and-the-toolbar-annotation)

If you’re looking to change how to order your stories, read about [sorting stories](../writing-stories/naming-components-and-hierarchy.md#sorting-stories).

## Configure Storybook’s UI

To control the behavior of Storybook’s UI (the **“manager”**), you can create a `.storybook/manager.js` file.

This file does not have a specific API but is the place to set [UI options](./features-and-behavior.md) and to configure Storybook’s [theme](./theming.md).
