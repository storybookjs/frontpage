<YouTubeCallout id="zrdcCSTGo4A" title="How to Configure the Sidebar" />

Storybook’s sidebar lists all your stories grouped by component. When you have many components, you may also wish to group those components. To do so, you can add the `/` separator to the `title` of your CSF file, and Storybook will group the stories into groups based on common prefixes:

![Storybook sidebar anatomy](./sidebar-anatomy.png)

We recommend using a nesting scheme that mirrors the filesystem path of the components. For example, if you have a file `components/modals/Alert.js`, name the CSF file `components/modals/Alert.stories.js` and title it `Components/Modals/Alert`.

## Roots

By default, Storybook will treat your top-level nodes as “roots”. Roots are displayed in the UI as “sections” of the hierarchy. Lower level groups will show up as folders:

![Storybook sidebar story roots](./sidebar-roots.png)

If you’d prefer to show top-level nodes as folders rather than roots, you can set the `sidebar.showRoots` option to `false` in [`./storybook/manager.js`](./features-and-behavior.md):

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-manager-disable-roots.js.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Permalink to stories

By default, Storybook generates an `id` for each story based on the component title and the story name. This `id` in particular is used in the URL for each story, and that URL can serve as a permalink (primarily when you [publish](../sharing/publish-storybook.md) your Storybook).

Consider the following story:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'angular/foo-bar-baz-story.ts.mdx',
    'web-components/foo-bar-baz-story.js.mdx',
    'web-components/foo-bar-baz-story.ts.mdx',
    'common/foo-bar-baz-story.js.mdx',
    'common/foo-bar-baz-story.ts.mdx',
  ]}
  usesCsf3
  csf2Path="configure/sidebar-and-urls#snippet-foo-bar-baz-story"
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Storybook's ID-generation logic will give this the `id` `foo-bar--baz`, so the link would be `?path=/story/foo-bar--baz`.

It is possible to manually set the story's id, which is helpful if you want to rename stories without breaking permalinks. Suppose you want to change the position in the hierarchy to `OtherFoo/Bar` and the story name to `Moo`. Here's how to do that:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'angular/other-foo-bar-story.ts.mdx',
    'web-components/other-foo-bar-story.js.mdx',
    'web-components/other-foo-bar-story.ts.mdx',
    'common/other-foo-bar-story.js.mdx',
    'common/other-foo-bar-story.ts.mdx',
  ]}
  usesCsf3
  csf2Path="configure/sidebar-and-urls#snippet-other-foo-bar-story"
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Storybook will prioritize the `id` over the title for ID generation if provided and prioritize the `story.name` over the export key for display.

## CSF 3.0 auto-titles

Storybook 6.4 introduced [CSF 3.0](https://storybook.js.org/blog/component-story-format-3-0/) as an experimental feature, allowing you to write stories more compactly. Suppose you're already using this format to write your stories. In that case, you can omit the `title` element from the default export and allow Storybook automatically infer it based on the file's physical location. For example, given the following configuration and story:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-main-configuration-src-dir.main-js.js.mdx',
    'common/storybook-main-configuration-src-dir.main-ts.ts.mdx',
    'angular/component-story-auto-title.csf3-story-ts.ts.mdx',
    'web-components/component-story-auto-title.csf3-story-ts.js.mdx',
    'web-components/component-story-auto-title.csf3-story-ts.ts.mdx',
    'common/component-story-auto-title.csf3-story.js.mdx',
    'common/component-story-auto-title.csf3-story-ts.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

When Storybook loads, the story can show up in the sidebar as `components/My Component`.

Auto-titles work with explicit titling options like the component's `title` and the story's `name`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/csf-3-example-title.ts.mdx',
    'common/csf-3-example-title.mdx.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Auto-title filename case

Starting with Storybook 6.5, story titles generated automatically no longer rely on Lodash's [startCase](https://lodash.com/docs/#startCase).
Instead, the file name casing is preserved, allowing additional control over the story title. For example, `components/My Component` will be defined as `components/MyComponent`.

If you need, you can revert to the previous pattern by adding the following configuration:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-manager-render-label-stories.js.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Auto-title redundant filenames

In addition to improvements to the story file name casing, a new heuristic was introduced, removing redundant names in case the filename has the same name as the directory name, or if it's called `index.stories.js|ts`. For example, before `components/MyComponent/MyComponent.stories.js` was defined as `Components/MyComponent/MyComponent` in the sidebar. Now it will be defined as `Components/MyComponent`.

If you need to preserve the naming scheme, you can add the `title` element to the default export. For example:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'angular/storybook-csf-3-auto-title-redundant.ts.mdx',
    'common/storybook-csf-3-auto-title-redundant.js.mdx',
    'common/storybook-csf-3-auto-title-redundant.ts.mdx',
  ]}
  usesCsf3
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Auto-title prefixes

Additionally, if you customize your Storybook to load your stories based on a [configuration object](./index.md#with-a-configuration-object), including a `titlePrefix`, Storybook automatically prefixes all titles to matching stories. For example, assuming you have the following configuration:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<CodeSnippets
  paths={[
    'common/storybook-main-auto-title-custom.js.mdx',
    'common/storybook-main-auto-title-custom.ts.mdx',
  ]}
/>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

When Storybook generates the titles for all matching stories, they'll retain the `Custom` prefix.

### Story Indexers

[Story Indexers](../api/main-config-indexers.md) are a set of heuristics used by Storybook to crawl your filesystem based on a given glob pattern searching for matching stories, which is then used to generate an `index.json` (formerly `stories.json`) file responsible for populating the sidebar with the necessary information. By default, this heuristic will look for files that contain the following scheme `*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)`.

You can provide your own indexer to include stories with a different naming convention, adjust the automatic title generation beyond a prefix, and many other use cases. For more information, see the [Story Indexers API reference](../api/main-config-indexers.md).
