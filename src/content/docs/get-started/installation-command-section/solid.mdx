Use the Storybook CLI to install it in a single command. Run this inside your _existing project’s_ root directory:

- With npm:

```shell
npx storybook@next init
```

- With pnpm:

```shell
pnpm dlx storybook@next init
```

If you run into issues with the installation, check the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below for guidance on how to solve it.
