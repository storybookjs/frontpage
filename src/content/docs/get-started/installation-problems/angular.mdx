- Add the `--type angular` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest init --type angular
  ```

- Storybook's CLI provides support for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use another as your default package manager add the `--package-manager` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest init --package-manager=npm
  ```

- Storybook supports Webpack 5 out of the box. If you're upgrading from a previous version, run the following command to enable it:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest automigrate
  ```

  Check the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#automigrate) for more information on how to set up Webpack 5.

- If you're using the custom Storybook builder, Storybook will not automatically open a browser window or tab. It's is a known issue that we plan to fix in future releases.

- When adding Storybook to your Angular project, check if you're running the install command from the root directory. Or in a monorepo environment inside the directory where the `angular.json` file is located.

- If you need further customization to the Storybook builder configuration, you can use the following table as a reference:
