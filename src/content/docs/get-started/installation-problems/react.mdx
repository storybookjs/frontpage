- Add the `--type react` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest init --type react
  ```

- Storybook's CLI provides support for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use another as your default package manager add the `--package-manager` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest init --package-manager=npm
  ```

- Storybook supports Webpack 5 out of the box. If you're upgrading from a previous version, run the following command to enable it:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest automigrate
  ```

Check the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#cra5-upgrade) for more information on how to set up Webpack 5.

- For other installation issues, check the React README files for additional instructions:
