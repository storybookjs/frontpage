- Add the `--type svelte` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest init --type svelte
  ```

- Storybook's CLI provides support for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use another as your default package manager add the `--package-manager` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest init --package-manager=npm
  ```

### Svelte Native

To enable support for Svelte Native story format you'll need to make the following changes your Storybook configuration:
- Add the [`@storybook/addon-svelte-csf`](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-svelte-csf/) addon as development dependency.
- Enable the addon in your Storybook configuration file (e.g., `.storybook/main.js`).
- Disable on demand story loading configuration property (e.g., `storyStoreV7`) in your Storybook configuration file.
- For issues with Svelte Native Story Format, check the [Svelte Story Format addon repository](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-svelte-csf) for instructions.


- For other installation issues, check the Svelte README files for additional instructions:
