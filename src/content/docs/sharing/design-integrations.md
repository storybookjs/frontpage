Storybook integrates with design tools to speed up your development workflow. That helps you debug inconsistencies earlier in the design process, discover existing components to reuse, and compare designs to stories.

## Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a collaborative UI design tool that allows multiple people to work on the same design simultaneously in the browser. There are two ways to integrate Storybook and Figma.

### Embed Storybook in Figma with the plugin

[Storybook Connect](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1056265616080331589/Storybook-Connect) is a Figma plugin that allows you to embed component stories in Figma. It’s powered by [Storybook embeds](./embed.md) and [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/?utm_source=storybook_website&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=storybook), a publishing tool created by the Storybook team.

#### Install plugin

Before we begin, you must have a Storybook [published to Chromatic](./publish-storybook.md#publish-storybook-with-chromatic). It provides the index, versions, and access control that back the plugin.

Go to [Storybook Connect](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1056265616080331589/Storybook-Connect) to install the plugin.

In Figma, open the command palette (in Mac OS, use `Command + /`, in Windows use `Control + /`) and type `Storybook Connect` to enable it.

![Figma palette Storybook connect](./figma-plugin-open-in-figma.png)

Follow the instructions to connect and authenticate with Chromatic.

#### Link stories to Figma components

Link stories to Figma components, variants, and instances.

Go to a story in a Storybook published on Chromatic. Make sure it’s on the branch you want to link. Then copy the URL to the story.

In Figma, select the component, open the plugin, and paste the URL.

![Story linked in Figma](./figma-plugin-paste-url.png)

Chromatic will automatically update your linked stories to reflect the most recent Storybook published on the branch you linked. That means the link persists even as you push new code.

<Callout variant="info" icon="💡">

The plugin does not support linking stories to Figma layers.

#### View stories in Figma

Once they're connected, you'll be able to view the story by clicking the link in the sidebar. Click "View story". Alternatively, open the plugin by using the command palette (in Mac OS, use `Command + /`, in Windows, use `Control + /`), then type `Storybook Connect`.
